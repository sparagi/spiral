My instances provide a visible interface to a configurable action.

My collaborators and I (see the classs comment of SpiralNotebook) are a large-scale refactoring of BookMorph, its subclasses, and its collaborators.  I correspond to some uses of  TabMorph.

Instance variables:

target			the object to send a message to when this instance is clicked
actionSelector	the messsage to send when this instance is clicked
arguments		the arguments for the message to send when this instance is clicked
