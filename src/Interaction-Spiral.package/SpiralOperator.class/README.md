I am an abstract class.  Instances of my concrete subclasses provide a visible interface for a human to perform operations on an associated SpiralNotebook and its components.

My collaborators and I (see the classs comment of SpiralNotebook) are a large-scale refactoring of BookMorph, its subclasses, and its collaborators.  My functionality was previously part of BookMorph itself.
